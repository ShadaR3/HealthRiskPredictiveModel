This project focuses on developing a robust model to predict the likelihood of individuals developing specific health conditions based on demographic, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors. It utilizes a comprehensive dataset to identify key risk factors and potential correlations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Healthcare Survey Dataset (Canada) – 2019-2020, available on Kaggle:

[Healthcare Survey Dataset (Canada) – 2019-2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aradhanahirapara/healthcare-survey)

This dataset contains anonymized responses from the Canadian Health Survey (2019-2020), offering valuable insights into various health-related aspects, lifestyle choices, and medical conditions of individuals across different provinces. It serves as an excellent resource for public health analysis, machine learning applications, and predictive modeling.

## Analyzed Health Conditions

This analysis focused on identifying risks and correlations related to the following health conditions:

* Mental Health State
* Sleep Apnea
* High Blood Pressure
* High Cholesterol
* Diabetes
* Cardiovascular Condition
* Respiratory Chronic Condition
* Mood Disorder
* Anxiety Disorder
* Fatigue Syndrome

## Key Correlations and Dependencies Identified

Based on the analysis of the dataset, the following correlations and dependencies were observed:

* **Mental Health State:** Correlated with BMI, physical activity levels, stress levels, and life satisfaction.
* **Sleep Apnea:** Correlated with anxiety disorder, pain status, BMI, and age.
* **High Blood Pressure:** Correlated with stress levels, cardiovascular conditions, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and life satisfaction.
* **High Cholesterol:** Correlated with age, duration of smoking, heart conditions, and high blood pressure.
* **Diabetes:** Correlated with general health state (potentially indicating it as an early impacting condition), age at which smoking started, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, musculoskeletal conditions, cardiovascular conditions, education level, smoking habits, physical activity levels, BMI, and respiratory chronic conditions.
* **Cardiovascular Condition:** Correlated with BMI, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and smoking habits.
* **Respiratory Chronic Condition:** Correlated with general health state (possibly indicating a significant impact on life quality), cannabis use, age at which smoking started, anxiety and sleep issues, age at which alcohol consumption started, marital status, musculoskeletal and cardiovascular conditions, and total income.
* **Mood Disorder:** Correlated with pain status, mental health state, and work-related stress.
* **Anxiety Disorder:** Correlated with mental health risks and sleep apnea.
* **Fatigue Syndrome:** Correlated with mental health risks, general health state, cardiovascular risks, musculoskeletal conditions, health utility index, and insurance coverage.

## Conclusion

This research, based on the Canadian Health Survey dataset, provides valuable insights into the complex relationships between various factors and the likelihood of developing specific health conditions. These identified correlations and dependencies can be further utilized for building predictive models and informing public health initiatives.
